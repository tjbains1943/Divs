  "description": "## Requirements: ## * build a page that has 4 divs and they look exactly like in the screenshots provided at the end of this requirements * use the template provided in this repository * initial state of each div: * div1 - has width 25%, a responsive background image ( see $cover_image ), on click width becomes 100% * div2 - has width 75&, background color orange, contains a random image from $random_images array - every refresh should pull a random image, on click width becomes 100% * div3 - has width 50%, background color blue, on click width becomes 100% and background color animates into a red * div4 - has with 90%, shows an iteration of numbers (see details below) * **iteration of numbers**: *using a SINGLE for loop and no arrays please output: 1 3 5 7 9 7 5 3 1* * the page needs to be responsive - all divs will fill in the entire vertical space - please see screenshot - if page resizes their sizes are changed accordingly see screenshot  * when you click one of the divs (#div1,#div2, #div3, #div4) their state needs to toogle *     - example: - if you click #div1 - width goes 100% - if you click again it goes back to initial state ( width 25%) - if you click again it goes back to width 100% etc *                - if you click #div2 - width goes 100% - the image is still centered - if you click again it goes back to initial state - if you click again it goes back to width 100% etc *                - if you click #div3 - width goes 100% and at the same time the background color changes to red - if you click again it goes back to initial state (background color as well) - if you click again it goes back to width 100% and background color red etc *                - if you click #div4 - width goes 100% - the text is always centered -  if you click again it goes back to initial state - if you click again it goes back to width 100% etc *                 * IMPORTANT! For every click on any of the divs (#div1, #div2, #div3, #div4) you need to make an AJAX call and save a cookie with the state of that div - if you refresh the page the div should have the same state as the last time you clicked it: *     - example: - if I click #div1 and the width goes 100% - if I refresh the page that div needs to have width 100% - please take a look at the video at the end of this readme file; *     - if I click #div3 and the width goes 100% and background red - that means if I refresh the page that div will have width 100% and and background red - please take a look at the video at the end of this readme file * If the screen size is smaller or equal than 600px then the div3 and div4 should be hidden.",
